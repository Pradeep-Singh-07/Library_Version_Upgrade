# Interface: Device

Represents a device in Cobrowse. A device in Cobrowse is how a single instance of an app or website is tracked by Cobrowse.
Each website within each different browser on a user's machine will be tracked as a separate device. Devices can be listed
and filtered by support agents to find a specific user's device. Read more about
[Identifying your devices](https://docs.cobrowse.io/sdk-features/identify-your-devices) to add metadata for filtering.

```javascript
const cobrowse = new CobrowseAPI(...)
const device = await cobrowse.device.get('some device id here')
device.subscribe()
device.on('updated', d => console.log('device was updated', d))
```
