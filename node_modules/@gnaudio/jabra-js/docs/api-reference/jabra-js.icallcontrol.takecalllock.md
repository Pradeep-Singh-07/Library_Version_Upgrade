## ICallControl.takeCallLock() method

Tries to acquire a call lock. The call lock is a unique, per-device lock, and is required to change the device state. Acquiring a call lock must be the first step in performing call control operations.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
takeCallLock(): Promise<boolean>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;boolean&gt;

A Promise that resolves with `true` if the call lock is successfully acquired, `false` otherwise.

## Exceptions

If you have already call locked the device.

## Remarks

Acquiring a call lock can fail. This can happen for the following reasons: \* The device is call locked by another softphone using the Jabra SDK, resulting in `false` being returned. \* The device is call locked by another instance of your softphone implementation. This results in `false` being returned. \* You've already call locked the device (and therefore can proceed with any other functionality that requires the call lock). This results in an Exception being thrown
