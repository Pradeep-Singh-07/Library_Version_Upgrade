## ICallControl interface

Defines the necessary functionality for call control: - being able to start/end a call, - mute/unmute the microphone, - hold/resume a call, - start/stop the ringer on the device, - events for emitted signals from the device, and - the required call lock for executing all of these functions.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare interface ICallControl 
```

## Remarks

All of this functionality is associated with a single physical device. For every connected Jabra headset, there is an additional instance of `ICallControl` that is used to manipulate its call-related state and functionality.

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [device](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.device.md) | <code>readonly</code> | [IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md) | The single physical device with which the call control functionalities are associated. |
|  [deviceSignals](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.devicesignals.md) | <code>readonly</code> | Observable&lt;[ICallControlSignal](./jabra-js.icallcontrolsignal.md)<!-- -->&gt; | <p>Observable for signals emitted by the device.</p><p>Whenever the device sends a new signal, this observable will be populated with [ICallControlSignal](./jabra-js.icallcontrolsignal.md) instances for each emission.</p> |
|  [onDisconnect](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.ondisconnect.md) | <code>readonly</code> | Observable&lt;void&gt; | Emits when the connection used for call control gets disconnected. |

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [hold(shouldHold)](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.hold.md) | Tells the device whether an active call was put on hold or a held up call was resumed. |
|  [mute(shouldMute)](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.mute.md) | Mutes or unmutes the microphone of the Jabra device. |
|  [offHook(isOffHook)](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.offhook.md) | Informs the Jabra device that there's a change in the call status. |
|  [releaseCallLock()](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.releasecalllock.md) | <p>Releases a previously acquired call lock.</p><p>Releasing the call lock is the last step in performing call control operations so remember to execute it once you are done with the Jabra device.</p> |
|  [ring(shouldRing)](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.ring.md) | Starts or ends the "ring" effect on the Jabra device. Used to indicate an incoming call. |
|  [takeCallLock()](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.takecalllock.md) | Tries to acquire a call lock. The call lock is a unique, per-device lock, and is required to change the device state. Acquiring a call lock must be the first step in performing call control operations. |
