## IMultiCallControl interface

Defines the necessary functionality for easy call control, when handling multiple calls.

This functionality includes: - being able to start an outgoing call, - signaling an incoming call, answer and reject it, - mute/unmute the microphone, - subscribing to device events, - ending a call, and - holding/resuming/swapping a call (unlike [ISingleCallControl](./jabra-js.isinglecallcontrol.md)<!-- -->).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare interface IMultiCallControl extends IEasyCallControlBase 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [IEasyCallControlBase](./jabra-js.ieasycallcontrolbase.md)

## Remarks

All of this functionality is associated with a single physical device. For every connected Jabra headset, there is an additional instance of [IEasyCallControlBase](./jabra-js.ieasycallcontrolbase.md) that is used to manipulate its call-related state and functionality.

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [holdState](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.holdstate.md) |  | Observable&lt;[HoldState](./jabra-js.holdstate.md)<!-- -->&gt; | Emits the hold state of the device whenever that state changes. |
|  [ongoingCalls](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.ongoingcalls.md) |  | Observable&lt;number&gt; | <p>Emits the number of calls currently in progress.</p><p><code>0</code> means that the device is idle with no calls in progress, while <code>1</code> or more signifies the number of calls currently active.</p><p>Starting a new call - or accepting an incoming call - will increment this counter. Similarly, ending a call will decrement the count until it reaches 0.</p> |
|  [swapRequest](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.swaprequest.md) |  | Observable&lt;undefined&gt; | <p>Emits whenever swap request is triggered.</p><p>This can happen due to interaction with the device (most often the same button that triggers hold) or due to interaction with your softphone (e.g. pressing a swap button in the GUI).</p> |

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [acceptIncomingCall(behavior)](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.acceptincomingcall.md) | Accepts an incoming call and sets the device into call state. |
|  [hold()](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.hold.md) | Sets the current call on hold. |
|  [resume()](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.resume.md) | Resumes the current call when on hold. |
