## IConfig.logger property

Implementation of the [ILogger](./jabra-js.ilogger.md) interface, used for logging runtime messages. Can be a custom implementation depending on the user's needs.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
logger?: ILogger;
```

## Remarks

By default, the Jabra SDK logs messages as it executes its usual operations. These log events can be intercepted by implementing the [ILogger](./jabra-js.ilogger.md) interface, and providing your own custom functionality.

For an example of how to do this, see the section 'Setting the library logging' inside 'Initializing the core module' in the JavaScript Developer's Guide.
