## ICallControl.offHook() method

Informs the Jabra device that there's a change in the call status.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
offHook(isOffHook: boolean): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  isOffHook | boolean | The new offHook status of the device. Use <code>true</code> when a call becomes active, regardless of call type (outgoing or incoming). Use <code>false</code> when a call has ended and the device is no longer used. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Exceptions

If a call lock was not acquired prior to execution. See [ICallControl.takeCallLock()](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.takecalllock.md) for more details.

## Remarks

This controls if the device considers itself in an active call. When offHook is true, a call is ongoing, otherwise there is no active call.
