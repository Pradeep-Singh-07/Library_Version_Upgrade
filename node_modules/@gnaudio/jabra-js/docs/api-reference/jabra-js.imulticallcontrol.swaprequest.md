## IMultiCallControl.swapRequest property

Emits whenever swap request is triggered.

This can happen due to interaction with the device (most often the same button that triggers hold) or due to interaction with your softphone (e.g. pressing a swap button in the GUI).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
swapRequest: Observable<undefined>;
```

## Remarks

The observable does not emit any value, and it does not keep track of what call was swapped to or from - this should be handled by the softphone application.

The most common implementation pattern would be to maintain a list of ongoing calls in the softphone application. Then, whenever swap is triggered, the active call is moved to the next call in line.
