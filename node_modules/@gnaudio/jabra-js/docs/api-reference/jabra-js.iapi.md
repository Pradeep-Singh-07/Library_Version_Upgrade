## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [\_config?](./jabra-js.iapi._config.md) |  | [IConfig](./jabra-js.iconfig.md) | <i>(Optional)</i> The configuration that was used to initialize the SDK. |
|  [\_readyEvents](./jabra-js.iapi._readyevents.md) |  | Observable&lt;any&gt; | Emits when the SDK has initialized and is ready for operation. The observable will replay on new subscriptions. |
|  [\_transport](./jabra-js.iapi._transport.md) |  | [ITransport](./jabra-js.itransport.md) | \_Internal use only\_. Acts as a bridge between the SDK and the object which communicates with the OS and the Jabra device. |
|  [deviceAdded](./jabra-js.iapi.deviceadded.md) |  | Observable&lt;[IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md)<!-- -->&gt; | An observable which emits newly discovered Jabra devices. The emitted device object can be consumed by the third party developer. See [IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md) for more information. |
|  [deviceList](./jabra-js.iapi.devicelist.md) |  | Observable&lt;[IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md)<!-- -->\[\]&gt; | A list of connected physical Jabra devices. Each device object can be consumed by the third party developer. See [IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md) for more information. |
|  [deviceRemoved](./jabra-js.iapi.deviceremoved.md) |  | Observable&lt;[IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md)<!-- -->&gt; | An observable which emits disconnected Jabra devices. The emitted device object represents the device that has been disconnected. See [IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md) for more information. |
|  [transportContext](./jabra-js.iapi.transportcontext.md) |  | [TransportContext](./jabra-js.transportcontext.md) | Get the underlying transport context. Especially relevant when running in the browser to distinguish between WebHID and Chrome Extension/Host See enum [TransportContext](./jabra-js.transportcontext.md) |

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [getChromeExtensionVersion()](./jabra-js.iapi.getchromeextensionversion.md) | <p>Get the Jabra Chrome Extension version</p><p>In node context, the Chrome Extension is unnecessary and will always return null.</p><p>In browser context, the Chrome Extension is a required component that needs to be installed separately from this npm-package - unless the library is configured to use WebHID-transport, see [IConfig.transport](./jabra-js.iconfig.transport.md)<!-- -->.</p> |
|  [getChromehostVersion()](./jabra-js.iapi.getchromehostversion.md) | <p>Get the Jabra Chromehost version</p><p>Chromehost is the native console application communicating with the USB-layer.</p><p>In node context, the Chromehost will be embedded in the jabra-js stack, and not something to be concerned with as an SDK-user.</p><p>In browser context, the Chromehost is a required application that needs to be installed separately from this npm-package - unless the library is configured to use WebHID-transport, see [IConfig.transport](./jabra-js.iconfig.transport.md)<!-- -->.</p> |
|  [getVersion()](./jabra-js.iapi.getversion.md) | Returns the Jabra SDK version |
