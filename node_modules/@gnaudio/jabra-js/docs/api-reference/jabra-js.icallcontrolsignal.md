## ICallControlSignal interface

Represents a signal that is emitted from a Jabra device. These signals notify you that something has happened on the device.

This could be:

- the user expressing an intent to do something by interacting with the device (e.g. pressing a button).

- acknowledgement to a request (e.g. a [SignalType.HOOK\_SWITCH](./jabra-js.signaltype.md) signal after your softphone starts a call successfully).

- an error condition (e.g. headset out of range from the base station).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare interface ICallControlSignal 
```

## Remarks

Reacting to incoming signals is an advanced topic. Before implementing your solution, we urge you to check out the Integrator's guide.
