## ISingleCallControl.acceptIncomingCall() method

Accepts an incoming call and sets the device into call state.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
acceptIncomingCall(): Promise<void>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;

## Exceptions

If an incoming call is not pending.

## Remarks

If there is already an active call, it will be ended before accepting the incoming call.

The call can be accepted by the user by interacting with their device or with your softphone. In the first case, the incoming call will be automatically accepted and [IEasyCallControlBase.signalIncomingCall()](./jabra-js.ieasycallcontrolbase.signalincomingcall.md) will resolve with `true`<!-- -->. The second case requires your softphone to manually call this method, before the incoming call is accepted and [IEasyCallControlBase.signalIncomingCall()](./jabra-js.ieasycallcontrolbase.signalincomingcall.md) is resolved with `true`<!-- -->.
