|  --- | --- | --- |
|  DEVICE\_ERROR | <code>&quot;device-error&quot;</code> | <p>Specifies an error which is thrown when communicating with a Jabra device.</p><p>This can happen due to several reasons, e.g. device disconnected during packet transmission.</p><p>Depending on the reason, this could either mean that the operation is fatal or that it might work if attempted again.</p> |
|  FEATURE\_NOT\_SUPPORTED | <code>&quot;feature-not-supported&quot;</code> | Specifies an error which is thrown when the specified command/feature is not supported by the device, e.g. trying to mute a device that does not have a microphone. |
|  INIT\_ERROR | <code>&quot;init-error&quot;</code> | <p>Specifies an error which is thrown due to incorrect initialization.</p><p>The user either has not installed the necessary components (e.g. Chrome extension, console application), or they have not provided correct arguments when initializing the Jabra SDK (e.g. missing/incomplete softphone information)</p> |
|  SDK\_USAGE\_ERROR | <code>&quot;sdk-usage-error&quot;</code> | <p>Specifies an error which is thrown when events were not executed in the expected order, e.g. trying to mute a device without having the call lock.</p><p>These are usually fixable errors and happen due to control flow.</p> |
