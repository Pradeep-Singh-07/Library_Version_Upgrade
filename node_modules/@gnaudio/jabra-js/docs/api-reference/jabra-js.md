## jabra-js package

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [CallControlFactory](./jabra-js.callcontrolfactory.md) | <p>Enables the creation of a device with call control functionality.</p><p>A CallControlFactory is initialized by passing in softphone information and the core [IApi](./jabra-js.iapi.md) interface. It can then be used to create [ICallControl](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.md) instances.</p> |
|  [DeviceId](./jabra-js.deviceid.md) | The identifier of a single [IDevice](./jabra-js.idevice.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [EasyCallControlFactory](./jabra-js.easycallcontrolfactory.md) | Enables the creation of [ISingleCallControl](./jabra-js.isinglecallcontrol.md) and [IMultiCallControl](./jabra-js.imulticallcontrol.md) objects which offer easy call control functionality on a specific connection that belongs on a specific device. |
|  [JabraError](./jabra-js.jabraerror.md) | Implementation of [IJabraError](./jabra-js.ijabraerror.md) interface which extends the base <code>Error</code> class by adding an [ErrorType](./jabra-js.errortype.md) property. |

|  [StackLayer](./jabra-js.stacklayer.md) | The stack layer in which the log event occurred, i.e. which module caused the [ILogEvent](./jabra-js.ilogevent.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [TrackingOptions](./jabra-js.trackingoptions.md) | Used by [IConfig.tracking](./jabra-js.iconfig.tracking.md) to determine the level of allowed tracking of Jabra library usage and errors - defaults to NO\_TRACKING. |
|  [TransportContext](./jabra-js.transportcontext.md) | Transport context to determine what mechanism is used to communicate with connected devices |
|  [ValueType](./jabra-js.valuetype.md) | The type of values that the usage will report or use |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [init(config)](./jabra-js.init.md) | Initialize the Jabra SDK. Entry point to being able to control Jabra hardware. |
|  [webHidPairing()](./jabra-js.webhidpairing.md) | <p>Triggers WebHID consent dialogue in compatible browsers</p><p>For an example of how to use this, see the 'Using WebHid' chapter in the 'Initializing the Jabra library' section of the JavaScript Developer's Guide.</p> |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [IApi](./jabra-js.iapi.md) | <p>Main Jabra API object. Returned after SDK initialization (see [init()](./jabra-js.init.md)<!-- -->).</p><p>Provides an entry point to reflecting and changing the state of Jabra devices.</p> |
|  [ICallControl](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.md) | Defines the necessary functionality for call control: - being able to start/end a call, - mute/unmute the microphone, - hold/resume a call, - start/stop the ringer on the device, - events for emitted signals from the device, and - the required call lock for executing all of these functions. |
|  [ICallControlSignal](./jabra-js.icallcontrolsignal.md) | <p>Represents a signal that is emitted from a Jabra device. These signals notify you that something has happened on the device.</p><p>This could be:</p><p>- the user expressing an intent to do something by interacting with the device (e.g. pressing a button).</p><p>- acknowledgement to a request (e.g. a [SignalType.HOOK\_SWITCH](./jabra-js.signaltype.md) signal after your softphone starts a call successfully).</p><p>- an error condition (e.g. headset out of range from the base station).</p> |
|  [IConfig](./jabra-js.iconfig.md) | Optional configuration used when initializing the Jabra SDK. |
|  [IConnection](./jabra-js.iconnection.md) | Describes the properties of a physical connection that was established between the system and a Jabra device. |

|  [ISingleCallControl](./jabra-js.isinglecallcontrol.md) | <p>Defines the necessary functionality for easy call control, when handling only one call at a time.</p><p>This functionality includes: - being able to start an outgoing call, - signaling incoming call, answer and reject it, - mute/unmute the microphone, - subscribing to device events, - ending a call.</p> |
|  [ISingleInitialState](./jabra-js.isingleinitialstate.md) | <p>Optional initial state for [ISingleCallControl](./jabra-js.isinglecallcontrol.md)<!-- -->.</p><p>Used to set the initial state if the device was changed in the middle of a call, or to recover the state after device disconnections.</p> |
