## IMultiCallControl.holdState property

Emits the hold state of the device whenever that state changes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
holdState: Observable<HoldState>;
```

## Remarks

This can happen due to interaction with the device (the hold command can differ between devices, but is often triggered by long-pressing the start/end-call button) or due to interaction with your softphone (e.g. pressing a hold button in the GUI).
