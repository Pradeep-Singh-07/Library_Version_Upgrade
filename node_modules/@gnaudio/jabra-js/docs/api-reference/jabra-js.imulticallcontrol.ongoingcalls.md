## IMultiCallControl.ongoingCalls property

Emits the number of calls currently in progress.

`0` means that the device is idle with no calls in progress, while `1` or more signifies the number of calls currently active.

Starting a new call - or accepting an incoming call - will increment this counter. Similarly, ending a call will decrement the count until it reaches 0.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
ongoingCalls: Observable<number>;
```

## Remarks

To handle multiple-call scenarios, ensure you keep your application's list of ongoing calls in sync with this count.

To handle one active call at a time, do one of the following: - treat this value as an ON-OFF toggle, - optionally throw an error if the count increases to more than 1, which would mean something went wrong in the application logic, or - use [ISingleCallControl](./jabra-js.isinglecallcontrol.md) instead.
