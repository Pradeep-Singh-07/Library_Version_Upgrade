## ICallControl.deviceSignals property

Observable for signals emitted by the device.

Whenever the device sends a new signal, this observable will be populated with [ICallControlSignal](./jabra-js.icallcontrolsignal.md) instances for each emission.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly deviceSignals: Observable<ICallControlSignal>;
```

## Remarks

Reacting to incoming signals is an advanced topic. Before implementing your solution, we urge you to check out the section on Interacting with Jabra Devices in the [Integrator's Guide](https://developer.jabra.com/site/global/software/documentation/integrators-guide/interacting-with-devices.gsp)<!-- -->.
