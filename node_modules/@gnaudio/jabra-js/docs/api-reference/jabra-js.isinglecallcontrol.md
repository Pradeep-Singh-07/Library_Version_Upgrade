## ISingleCallControl interface

Defines the necessary functionality for easy call control, when handling only one call at a time.

This functionality includes: - being able to start an outgoing call, - signaling incoming call, answer and reject it, - mute/unmute the microphone, - subscribing to device events, - ending a call.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare interface ISingleCallControl extends IEasyCallControlBase 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [IEasyCallControlBase](./jabra-js.ieasycallcontrolbase.md)

## Remarks

All of this functionality is associated with a single physical device. For every connected Jabra headset, there is an additional instance of [IEasyCallControlBase](./jabra-js.ieasycallcontrolbase.md) that is used to manipulate its call-related state and functionality.
