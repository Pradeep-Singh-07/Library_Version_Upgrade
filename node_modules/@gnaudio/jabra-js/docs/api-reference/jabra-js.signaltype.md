Definitions for incoming signals from Jabra devices related to call control.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum SignalType 
```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  ALT\_HOLD | <code>35</code> | <p>Indicates whether a call is on hold.</p><p><code>1</code> means there is a call on hold, while <code>0</code> means there is no call on hold.</p> |
|  ALT\_VOLUME\_DOWN | <code>234</code> | Indicates that the "volume down" button was pressed. |
|  ALT\_VOLUME\_UP | <code>233</code> | Indicates that the "volume up" button was pressed. |
|  ANSWER\_ON\_OFF | <code>116</code> | Toggles answering machine operation. |
|  FLASH | <code>33</code> | <p>This signal is reported in multiple scenarios:</p><p>- when the user requests to hold a call by interacting with the device,</p><p>- when the user requests to resume a call by interacting with the device, or</p><p>- when the user requests to swap the 'active' call (if there's multiple calls running on their system).</p> |
|  GN\_PSEUDO\_HOOK\_SWITCH | <code>65531</code> | Emitted if calling offHook(true) while the device is already in call state |
|  HOOK\_SWITCH | <code>32</code> | <p>The signal is reported in multiple scenarios:</p><p>- as an acknowledgement of a successful [ICallControl.offHook(true)](./jabra-js.icallcontrol.offhook.md) request made by your softphone,</p><p>- when the user is trying to accept an incoming call by interacting with the device, or</p><p>- when the user is trying to start a new outgoing call by interacting with the device.</p> |
|  LINE\_BUSY | <code>151</code> | <p>Indicates whether the device is currently in an active call (<code>true</code>) or not (<code>false</code>).</p><p>The value of the signal is not exclusive to your softphone, and will also be sent from the device when other softphones start a call.</p> |
|  ONLINE | <code>42</code> | <p>This signal is reported by wireless adapters (Bluetooth and DECT). It gives information on whether the adapter is transmitting audio to a connected device (<code>true</code>) or if the device is in power saving mode instead.</p><p>If the device is saving power, short audio cues might be cut off, as there is some latency before the device wakes up and re-establishes wireless audio link to the adapter.</p> |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_0 | <code>176</code> | Indicates that the number pad "0" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_1 | <code>177</code> | Indicates that the number pad "1" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_2 | <code>178</code> | Indicates that the number pad "2" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_3 | <code>179</code> | Indicates that the number pad "3" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_4 | <code>180</code> | Indicates that the number pad "4" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_5 | <code>181</code> | Indicates that the number pad "5" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_6 | <code>182</code> | Indicates that the number pad "6" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_7 | <code>183</code> | Indicates that the number pad "7" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_8 | <code>184</code> | Indicates that the number pad "8" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_9 | <code>185</code> | Indicates that the number pad "9" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_POUND | <code>187</code> | Indicates that the number pad "\#" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_KEY\_STAR | <code>186</code> | Indicates that the number pad "\*" button was pressed. |
|  PHONE\_MUTE | <code>47</code> | Indicates a change in the mute state of the microphone. |
|  REDIAL | <code>36</code> | Indicates that the user requests the softphone to repeat the most recent call. |
|  REJECT\_CALL | <code>65533</code> | Indicates that the user requests to reject an incoming call. |
|  RINGER | <code>158</code> | Indicates a change in the status of incoming calls. |
|  SEND | <code>49</code> | This indicates that the user has completed entering digits and is ready to begin routing the phone call. |
|  SPEAKER\_PHONE | <code>43</code> | This command is used to switch from headset to speaker phone and from speaker phone to headset (for applicable devices). |
|  SPEED\_DIAL | <code>80</code> | Indicates that a speed dial operation is initiating. |
|  VOICE\_MAIL | <code>112</code> | Enters voice mail application. |

## Remarks

This list might not be exhaustive.

There is a known issue with `PHONE_KEY` signals when using the SDK on Mac OS or Linux and running [TransportContext.NODE](./jabra-js.transportcontext.md)<!-- -->.
